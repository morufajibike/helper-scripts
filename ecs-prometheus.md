To integrate Prometheus with a Django app running on ECS, you can follow these high-level steps:

1. Create an Amazon ECR repository and push the Django app Docker image to it.
2. Create and configure an ECS cluster with the appropriate task definitions, services, and load balancer settings.
3. Deploy Prometheus using a Docker container on the ECS cluster.
4. Update your Django app code to enable Prometheus metrics endpoint and ensure that it is accessible via HTTP from outside the container.
5. Configure and customize Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Django app.

Here are the detailed steps for integrating Prometheus with your Django app:

Step 1: Create Amazon ECR Repository
- In the AWS Management Console, go to the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) service page and create a new repository.
- Build a Docker image of the Django app, and push it to the ECR repository.

Step 2: Create and configure an ECS Cluster
- Create a new ECS cluster, and choose the Fargate launch type.
- Create a task definition for the Django app, using the Docker image from the ECR repository.
- Create an ECS service, and associate it with the task definition.
- Set up a load balancer to route traffic to the ECS service.

Step 3: Deploy Prometheus
- Create a Docker image containing Prometheus server and push it to a registry such as Docker Hub or Amazon ECR.
- Define a new task definition for Prometheus, using the Docker image.
- Modify the ECS service to include the Prometheus task definition.

Step 4: Enable Prometheus Metrics in Django App
- Add the `django-prometheus` package to your Django project's dependencies.
- Update the Django app code to expose Prometheus metrics endpoint at `/metrics`.

For example, add this to your `urls.py` file:

```python
from django.urls import path
from prometheus_client import django as prometheus_django

urlpatterns = [
    # ... existing URL patterns ...
    path('metrics', prometheus_django.PrometheusMetricsView.as_view(), name='prometheus-metrics'),
]
```

Step 5: Configure and Customize Prometheus
- Update the `prometheus.yml` file to add a scrape configuration for the Django app.
- Add the appropriate labels and metrics filters to the Prometheus configuration based on the Django app's specific requirements.

Here's an example `prometheus.yml` configuration block for scraping metrics from a Django app:

```yaml
- job_name: django-app
  scrape_interval: 10s
  static_configs:
  - targets: ['<Django app load balancer IP or DNS>']
  metrics_path: /metrics
  scheme: http
  relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__address__]
    target_label: instance
  - source_labels: [__meta_ecs_task_definition_family]
    target_label: task_family
```

Once you have completed these steps, you should be able to see the Django app metrics in Prometheus.
